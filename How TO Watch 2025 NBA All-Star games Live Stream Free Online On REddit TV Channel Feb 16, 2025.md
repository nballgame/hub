Most notably, the NBA has completely revamped the format of the All-Star Game. This year, the All-Stars were drafted into three teams of eight players each by Shaquille O’Neal, Charles Barkley and Kenny Smith. Team Chris Mullin, which won the Rising Stars Challenge on Friday, will join the three other All-Star teams on Sunday night to play a mini single-elimination tournament.

Kenny’s Young Stars will face Chuck’s Global Stars in the semifinals, while Shaq’s OGs will face Candace’s Rising Stars (aka Team Mullin). The winners will then meet in the championship for the right to be named 2025 NBA All-Star champions. In each game, the teams will play to 40 points, and the first side to reach that mark wins.

NBA All-Star Weekend is here and it kicks off on Friday, Feb. 14 with the 2025 Ruffles NBA All-Star Celebrity Game at Oakland Arena in Oakland, Calif.
